# Attendance-capturing-system

Here I am capturing attendance using a video source. A FaceNet model is trained in Inception Resnet using pretrained VGGFace2.
Haarcascade classifier is used to detect faces from webcam and MTCNN to detect and align faces and the recognised face is stored in a csv file.

It is coded in Jupyter Notebook.
